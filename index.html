            <p>The Detroit Pistons opened up the season with a heartbreaking loss to the Miami Heat, 103-102. Cade Cunningham played his first game after missing the whole 2022-2023 season with season ending surgery. He led the team in scoring with 30 points shooting 13/27 from the field and 4/9 from three. Cade also had 9 assists to go with that. Cade played a great game with his biggest bucket coming near the end of the fourth to put the Pistons down 1. After this shot both teams didn't score for a full 1 minute and 46 seconds ultimately leading to the end score.</p>

            <p>Second in line in scoring was Pistons center Jalen Duren, finishing with 17 points and 14 rebounds. The second year pro had a very good game catching lobs from cade as well as 4 blocks on the Miami Heat offense. Despite a good showing from the two, Cade missing a three pointer with 2.5 seconds to win the game costed them this one. Overall, this seasons Pistons team </p>
