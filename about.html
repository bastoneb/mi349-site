    <p>My name is Benjamin Bastone and I am a student at Michigan State University. I decided to make my blog for MI349 about the Detroit Pistons because they are my favorite team. I enjoy watching and playing basketball almost everyday. Creating a blog about the team while also designing a website around it is something that I find very interesting.</p>
